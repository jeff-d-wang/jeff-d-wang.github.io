                Hello, welcome to my personal website. I am Jeffrey, but please call me Jeff. Previously from Massachusetts, I go
                to San Marino High School, located in San Marino, California. I intend on majoring Computer Science and Media
                Studies. I have been programming for quite a few years and I do everything that I can to improve. I am currently working on several projects,
                but you can contact me at any time if you need help! I would describe myself having a high rectitude and compassion.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What's on my mind:</strong>
                Setting up 
                <a href = "https://titanhacks.net/" target="_blank">titanHacks</a> 
                (club + hackathon), doing a side project and looking for a research opportunity!

            <p>
                Personally, I do not like the word resume being associated with a high schooler but here we are. This is by no means
                a complete, comprehesive list.

                        , offered including Intro to Coding (required), AP Computer Science, and the Caltech STEM
                        Research Program. Me and my peers are grateful for the opportunity the Caltech STEM
                        Research Program offers. It is in my best interest to share my story which is why I am documenting my

                        <strong>Computer Science: </strong>
                        I started learning about programming during 6th grade. During then, I was not doing very good in school.
                        I was a typical couch potato that was never really motivated to do anything. That is until I got my hands
                        on my first computer. After hours of browsing through the internet, I came across programming and was hooked.
                        Due to my middle school not offering a coding class, I started teaching myself Java and later took some
                        local classes. Later I talked to my middle school principle and was able to form a club to foster an
                        interest in programming at a young age. While it did not run for long, I made friends and learned more
                        about this field. It was 7-8th grade that I lept into computer science and learned about the math behind
                        famous algorithms like Merge Sort. By the end of middle school, I knew <strong>Java, Python, JS, HTML + CSS, C++,
                        C#</strong>, and very little of Swift. I'll be the first to admit it, I hit a low in terms of my motivation for CS.
                        I got back on it, however, end of 9th grade, where I began my journey to learn Machine Learning.
                        Here are some highlights of my total journey:

                        . My role on the team is within the fields of Programming, Business, and a bit of Mechanics. Our team has
                        done multiple outreach events aimed towards catching the public eye in STEM. We have also won multiple awards at our competitions.
                        Our main goals for this year are to implement Limelight into our future robots and win regionals.

                        <strong>Hackathon: </strong>
                        I've had a drive for hackathons ever since I entered middle school. I would particpate in 1-2 events
                        every year and since then, I have particpated in a total of 8+ hackathons. Hackathons were basically
                        a part of my life schedule up until I moved to Southern California. Most, if not all, hackathons in
                        California happened in the Bay Area. It is why three of my peers and I are organizing a hackathon near
                        Los Angeles to give back to the community. I have been a CodeDay LA organizer for a year so far and
                        being one has taught me the work required to run a hackathon. Here are some other things I have gotten
                        from hackathons I have been to:

                        <strong>TitanHacks: </strong>
                        At San Marino High School, many students associate programming with game design and undecipherable nonsense,
                        rather than what it actually is: a great tool for creation. At 
                        <a href = "https://titanhacks.net/" target="_blank">titanHacks</a>
                        , we introduce members to concepts and tools and foster an
                        environment of creativity so that, hopefully, members will be self-motivated to learn and produce.
                        Disclaimer: This club/organization is 100% student operated and <strong>not</strong> affiliated with the school.
                        We hope to cumulate the 2019 year with a intraclub hackathon and finish the 2019-2020 school year with
                        a publicly available hackathon. So far we know it will be held at Occidental College!

                        <strong>Summer: </strong>
                        Our school allows students to take certain classes during the summer. I took World History, Health,
                        and AP Psychology for graduation requirements and self-interest. I have done a lot of activities outside
                        of school. One being my time at Stanford for pre-collegiate studies where I learned about Artificial
                        Intelligence. Important things that I have gotten out of the program is a more defined idea on how A.I.
                        is used in our lives (and in the future) and the ethics behind it. I also grasped machine learning
                        concepts. For next summer (2020) I am looking for interships regarding research or company experience!

                        <strong>Sports: </strong>
                        I love sports and it has and will always be a part of my life. I started out playing football at my
                        elementary school until I got a knee injury. I was given constant warnings by my mother about playing
                        such a rash sport and I never listened until I flew too close to the sun. I then switched to swimming
                        where I practiced with Gator Swim Club and North Shore Swim Club to win multiple events and regionals. 
                        I started to get bored of the trite sport and so when I moved to California, waterpolo became my new
                        favorite sport. Why? It added a ball to swimming and an actual objective which involved more variables/
                        factors unlike swim. Height was also a factor but that's besides the point. We won the Rio Hondo
                        League in 2018 and qualified for CIF in 2019.
