                Hello, welcome to my personal website. I am Jeffrey, but please call me Jeff. Previously from Massachuetts, I go
                to San Marino High School, located in San Marino, California. I intend on majoring Computer Science and Media
                Studies. I have been programming for quite a few years and I do everything that I can to improve. I am currently working on several projects but you can contact me at
                any time if you need help! I would describe myself having a high rectitude and compassion.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What's on my mind:</strong>
                Currently setting up a hackathon for LA residents and working on this website!

            <h2 id = "aHighschoolersResume">A highschooler's "resume"</h2>
            <p>
                Personally, I do not like the word resume being associated with a high schooler but here we are. This is by no means
                a complete, comprehesive list.

                        <strong>Classes: </strong>
                        I took all the Computer Science classes that my school, 
                        <a href = "https://www.sanmarinohs.org" target="_blank">San Marino High School</a>
                        , offered including Intro to Coding (required), AP Computer Science, and the Caltech STEM
                        Research Program. I am also a Gold member on USACO.

                        <strong>FRC: </strong>
                        I am am a cabinet member for San Marino's FIRST Robotics Competition Team, 1160 
                        <a href = "https://titaniumrobotics.com/" target="_blank">Titanium Robotics</a>
                        . My role on the team is Programming, Business, and a bit of Mechanic. Our team has done multiple outreach
                        events aimed towards catching the public eye in STEM. We hae also won multiple awards at our competitions.
                        Our main goals for this year are to implement Limelight into our future robots and win regionals.

                        <strong>Hackathon: </strong>
                        I've had a drive for hackathons ever since I entered middle school. I would particpate in 1-2 events
                        every year and since then, I have particpated in a total of 6+ hackathons. Hackathons were basically
                        a part of my life schedule up until I moved to Southern California. Most, if not all, hackathons in
                        California happened in the Bay Area. It is why two of my peers and I are organizing a hackathon near
                        Los Angeles.

                        <strong>TitanHacks: </strong>
                        At San Marino High School, many students associate programming with game design and undecipherable nonsense,
                        rather than what it actually is: a great tool for creation. At 
                        <a href = "https://titanhacks.me/" target="_blank">titanHacks</a>
                        , we introduce members to concepts and tools and foster an
                        environment of creativity so that, hopefully, members will be self-motivated to learn and produce.
                        We hope to cumulate the 2019 year with a intraclub hackathon and finish the 2019-2020 school year with
                        a publicly availible hackathon.

                        <strong>Summer: </strong>
                        Our school allows students to take certain classes during the summer. I took World History, Health,
                        and AP Psychology for graduation requirements and self-interest. I have done a lot of activities outside
                        of school. One being my time at Stanford for pre-collegiate studies where I learned about Artificial
                        Intelligence. Important things that I have gotten out of the program is a more defined idea on how A.I.
                        is used in our lives (and in the future) and the ethics behind it. I also grasped machine learning
                        concepts. For next summer (2020) I am looking for interships regarding research or company experience!

                        <strong>Sports: </strong>
                        I love sports and it has and will always be a part of my life. I started out playing football at my
                        elementary school until I got a knee injury. I was given constant warnings by my mother about playing
                        such a rash sport and I never listened until I flew too close to the sun. I then switched to swimming
                        where I practiced with Gator Swim Club and North Shore Swim Club to win multiple events and regionals. 
                        I started to get bored of the trite sport and so when I moved to California, waterpolo became my new
                        favorite sport. Why? It added a ball to swimming and an actual objective which involved more variables/
                        factors unlike swim. Also because height didn't matter but that's besides the point! We won the Rio Hondo
                        League in 2018. Hoping for another dub the following years!

                        I write down my concerns and fears on a piece of paper. It is very important that I elaborate on each one so
                        that I can fully express what goes on in my mind. Then the day ends and by that time, I have already thoughtfully
                        evaluated them. I like to think of scrapping the papers at the end as removing them from my mind mentally
                        and physically.
